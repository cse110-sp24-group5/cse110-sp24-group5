## Introduction
In the fast-paced world of software development, productivity and mental well-being are crucial for success. Developers often find themselves juggling multiple tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities, which can lead to burnout and decreased efficiency. Our project aims to provide a comprehensive solution to address these challenges by offering a journal that not only boosts productivity throughout the development process but also helps developers keep track of their mental health.

The journal serves as a centralized hub where developers can effectively manage their tasks, document their progress, and reflect on their daily experiences. By combining powerful features such as a calendar, task management, and a markdown-enabled development journal, our application streamlines the workflow and encourages mindful practices. With the calendar feature, developers can easily navigate through different months, view task lists, and manage their tasks seamlessly. The development journal component allows developers to document their activities, thoughts, and learnings using a user-friendly markdown editor, while also selecting the roles they fulfilled on a given day. By integrating mental health considerations, our journal encourages developers to prioritize their well-being through regular reflection and journaling.

## CI/CD Pipeline
Our CI/CD pipeline ensures the quality and reliability of our code through the following stages:
1. **Run Linters**: Automatically checks for code style issues and potential bugs. 
2. **Generate JSDocs**: Creates up-to-date documentation for our code. 
3. **Run Unit Tests**: Verifies that individual components of our application work correctly. 
4. **Run End-to-End Tests**: Simulates real user interactions to validate the entire workflow.

## Linting
We used various linters including ESLint, StyleLint, and HTML Linting in our application. 
1. **ESLint**: Helps detect syntax errors and code style issues in our JavaScript
    * `npx eslint "**/*.js"` to run on all JS files
2. **StyleLint**: Helps detect style issues in CSS
    * `npx stylelint "**/*.css"` to run on all CSS files in the directory
3. **HTML Linting**: Helps detect issues in our HTML
    * `npx htmhint "**/*.html"` to run on all HTML files in the directory

## Testing
1. **Unit tests**:
    * ...
2. **E2E tests**:
