## Introduction
In the fast-paced world of software development, productivity and mental well-being are crucial for success. Developers often find themselves juggling multiple tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities, which can lead to burnout and decreased efficiency. Our project aims to provide a comprehensive solution to address these challenges by offering a journal that not only boosts productivity throughout the development process but also helps developers keep track of their mental health.

The journal serves as a centralized hub where developers can effectively manage their tasks, document their progress, and reflect on their daily experiences. By combining powerful features such as a calendar, task management, and a markdown-enabled development journal, our application streamlines the workflow and encourages mindful practices. With the calendar feature, developers can easily navigate through different months, view task lists, and manage their tasks seamlessly. The development journal component allows developers to document their activities, thoughts, and learnings using a user-friendly markdown editor, while also selecting the roles they fulfilled on a given day. By integrating mental health considerations, our journal encourages developers to prioritize their well-being through regular reflection and journaling.

## CI/CD Pipeline
Our Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is the backbone of our development process, ensuring that every code change maintains our project's quality and reliability. This automated workflow catches issues early, facilitates rapid iterations, and allows our team to focus on innovation rather than manual checks. It consists of the following.

1. **Linters:** Linters automatically scan every line of code for style inconsistencies, potential bugs, and bad practices. We use ESLint for JavaScript to catch syntax errors and enforce best practices, StyleLint for CSS to maintain consistent styles and flag inefficiencies, and HTMLHint for HTML to ensure proper structure and accessibility. Running on every commit and pull request, these tools not only catch issues early but also foster a consistent, readable codebase that eases collaboration and reduces bugs.

2. **JSDoc:** JSDoc transforms our inline documentation into a comprehensive, navigable manual. It parses our JavaScript files, extracting function signatures, class hierarchies, and module relationships to generate structured HTML docs. With features like type annotations, example usage, and architectural tags, JSDoc turns our codebase into a self-teaching tool. Running after linting in our CI/CD pipeline, it ensures our documentation always reflects our latest, standards-compliant code.

3. **Codacy Analysis:** While linters focus on syntax, Codacy dives deep into our code's health. This tool provides a holistic analysis across all our languagesâ€”JavaScript, CSS, and HTMLâ€”assigning an overall quality score. It identifies complex methods needing refactoring, flags security vulnerabilities like unsafe function usage, and suggests performance improvements. By tracking these metrics over time and setting quality gates in our CI/CD, Codacy doesn't just maintain our code; it drives a culture of continuous improvement.

4. **Unit Tests:**  Using Jest, we rigorously test everything from core utilities like our Markdown parser to individual class methods. Running after static analysis in our CI/CD, a failing unit test halts deployment, pinpointing exact issues.

5. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Our final and most comprehensive checks, E2E tests simulate real developer journeys through our application. Using Puppeteer to control a real Chrome browser, each test mirrors typical workflows. Beyond just UI interactions, we verify data integrity in storage and even run accessibility and performance checks. As the last gate in our CI/CD pipeline, these tests ensure that all our components work together.

Each stage of our CI/CD pipeline serves a distinct purpose, from enforcing code style to simulating user experiences. Together, they form a robust system that not only catches issues early but continually guides our project toward higher quality, clearer architecture, and a superior user experience.

## Linting
Linting is a crucial practice that helps ensure code quality, consistency, and maintainability across the entire codebase. In this project, linting has been set up for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to adhere to industry-standard best practices and coding conventions. HTML linting checks for proper markup structure, CSS linting maintains consistent stylesheet styles, and JavaScript linting catches syntax errors, potential bugs, and performance issues in the application's logic and functionality.

We have implemented automated linting checks performed on every push or pull request to make sure potential issues are caught early in the development process, and make sure that our coding standard is met. When you push changes, on GitHub you will be able to see a tick or cross next to it based on whether it passes that check. You can click on the same to view details. Along with this you can also run the linter locally.
 
1. **ESLint**: Helps detect syntax errors and code style issues in our JavaScript
    * `npx eslint "**/*.js"` to run on all JS files
      
2. **StyleLint**: Helps detect style issues in CSS
    * `npx stylelint "**/*.css"` to run on all CSS files in the directory
      
3. **HTML Linting**: Helps detect issues in our HTML
    * `npx htmhint "**/*.html"` to run on all HTML files in the directory
      
4. **Fixing local linter issues**: Run all commands with `--fix` tag in order to fix the linter issues.

## JSDoc

Automated and up-to-date documentation: By integrating JSDoc into our CI/CD pipeline, the documentation is automatically generated and updated whenever changes are pushed, ensuring that the documentation always reflects the latest codebase.

Consistent formatting and structure: JSDoc provides a consistent and standardized format for documenting functions, classes, and other code elements, making it easier for developers to navigate and understand the codebase.

Integration with development tools: Many IDEs and code editors have built-in support for JSDoc, allowing developers to easily view and access documentation while writing code.

## Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: 
    * Run all unit tests in the directory using:
        * `npm run unitTests`
          
    * Run a specific unit test file in the directory using:
        * `npm run unitTests -- <path to file>`
   
2. **E2E Tests**: We created a variety of comprehensive E2E tests to ensure that there are no issues or bugs in our application following any possible action a user could take.
    * List of our testing suites:
        * `home-page.e2e.js` which tests our homepage 
        * `dev-journal.e2e.js` which tests our developer journal feature
        * `taskListTestSuite.e2e.js` which tests our calendar and task-list feature
