## CI/CD Pipeline
Our CI/CD pipeline ensures the quality and reliability of our code through the following stages:
1. **Run Linters**: Automatically checks for code style issues and potential bugs. 
2. **Generate JSDocs**: Creates up-to-date documentation for our code. 
3. **Run Unit Tests**: Verifies that individual components of our application work correctly. 
4. **Run End-to-End Tests**: Simulates real user interactions to validate the entire workflow.

## Linting
We used various linters including ESLint, StyleLint, and HTML Linting in our application. 
1. **ESLint**: Helps detect syntax errors and code style issues in our JavaScript
    * `npx eslint "**/*.js"` to run on all JS files
2. **StyleLint**: Helps detect style issues in CSS
    * `npx stylelint "**/*.css"` to run on all CSS files in the directory
3. **HTML Linting**: Helps detect issues in our HTML
    * `npx htmhint "**/*.html"` to run on all HTML files in the directory

## Testing
1. **Unit tests**:
    * ...
