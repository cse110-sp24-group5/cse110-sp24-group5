<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the fast-paced world of software development, productivity and mental well-being are crucial for success. Developers often find themselves juggling multiple tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities, which can lead to burnout and decreased efficiency. Our project aims to provide a comprehensive solution to address these challenges by offering a journal that not only boosts productivity throughout the development process but also helps developers keep track of their mental health.</p>
<p>The journal serves as a centralized hub where developers can effectively manage their tasks, document their progress, and reflect on their daily experiences. By combining powerful features such as a calendar, task management, and a markdown-enabled development journal, our application streamlines the workflow and encourages mindful practices. With the calendar feature, developers can easily navigate through different months, view task lists, and manage their tasks seamlessly. The development journal component allows developers to document their activities, thoughts, and learnings using a user-friendly markdown editor, while also selecting the roles they fulfilled on a given day. By integrating mental health considerations, our journal encourages developers to prioritize their well-being through regular reflection and journaling.</p>

<h2>CI/CD Pipeline</h2>
<p>Our CI/CD pipeline ensures the quality and reliability of our code through the following stages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Run Linters</strong>: Automatically checks for code style issues and potential bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Generate JSDoc</strong>: Creates up-to-date documentation for our code.</li>
<li><strong>Run Codacy Tests</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Run Unit Tests</strong>: Verifies that individual components of our application work correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Run End-to-End Tests</strong>: Simulates real user interactions to validate the entire workflow.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Linting</h2>
<p>Linting is a crucial practice that helps ensure code quality, consistency, and maintainability across the entire codebase. In this project, linting has been set up for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to adhere to industry-standard best practices and coding conventions. HTML linting checks for proper markup structure, CSS linting maintains consistent stylesheet styles, and JavaScript linting catches syntax errors, potential bugs, and performance issues in the application's logic and functionality.</p>
<p>We have implemented automated linting checks performed on every push or pull request to make sure potential issues are caught early in the development process, and make sure that our coding standard is met. When you push changes, on GitHub you will be able to see a tick or cross next to it based on whether it passes that check. You can click on the same to view details. Along with this you can also run the linter locally.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>ESLint</strong>: Helps detect syntax errors and code style issues in our JavaScript</p>
<ul>
<li><code>npx eslint &quot;**/*.js&quot;</code> to run on all JS files</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>StyleLint</strong>: Helps detect style issues in CSS</p>
<ul>
<li><code>npx stylelint &quot;**/*.css&quot;</code> to run on all CSS files in the directory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HTML Linting</strong>: Helps detect issues in our HTML</p>
<ul>
<li><code>npx htmhint &quot;**/*.html&quot;</code> to run on all HTML files in the directory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fixing local linter issues</strong>: Run all commands with <code>-fix</code> tag</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>JSDoc</h2>
<p>Automated and up-to-date documentation: By integrating JSDoc into our CI/CD pipeline, the documentation is automatically generated and updated whenever changes are pushed, ensuring that the documentation always reflects the latest codebase.</p>
<p>Consistent formatting and structure: JSDoc provides a consistent and standardized format for documenting functions, classes, and other code elements, making it easier for developers to navigate and understand the codebase.</p>
<p>Integration with development tools: Many IDEs and code editors have built-in support for JSDoc, allowing developers to easily view and access documentation while writing code.</p>
