N/A

#### Things to be discussed

- How can we make the calendar appear nicely and centered on all screen sizes
- How can we make the gradient background appear nicely
- How can we ensure that the dates are being generated correctly

#### Unresolved from this meeting

- Deselecting dates
- Some months have extra days - want to figure out how to style
- Reading code and cleaning it up
- Dashboard button

## Decisions made and Reasoning

- Will create two different media queries (one for mobile and one for tablets)
    - The calendar will look too small when using the mobile media query on a tablet screen
      
- Styling the font and borders so that it is visible
    - We wanted to make the calendar look visually appealing
