Decided to use slides format formatted in this order
1) Statement of purpose
      - Shows the problem statement, goals, and generally what is are some values we want to uphold through the journals development.
2) User personas
      - Decided to pick three user personas to focus on in order to narrow down and prevent overcomplication.
      - Also decide what stuff out target audience isn't likely to want
3) Wireframe
      -  Display a sketch of what we envision the application to look like
      -  Explain what benefits different sections would provide
4) Nice to have
      -  Show some ideas that were considered in the brainstorming phase, but ultimately didn't make the cut because of added complexity/risk to product quality.
5) No Go's
      -  Some ideas that didn't mesh as well with the user stories and didn't make the cut/wouldn't be necessary to make a great product.
6) Developer Specific Features
      - Present the most important features for the journal. Needed to make the target users (developers) happy.
7) Appetite
      - Create resonable goals that we as the developers can reach within the alloted time frame.
9) Risks
      - Some possible issues that can cause problems for the completeed development of the application.
10) Rabbit Holes
      -  Bring up some features that can become problematic if we over complicate it.
   
Finally, we finished by styling and designing the slides.
