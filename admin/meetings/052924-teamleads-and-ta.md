### Feedback from TA

1. Look into branch pruning and remove useless branches
2. Test coverage (Code climage / Codeacy)
3. PWA
4. Comment adequately but not too much
5. Test manually to see it does not break when you test/use it
6. If you get user feedback (it is important), try to include that in the report.
7. Akshay will be holding final interviews later this week or week 10. Potential questions:

   What have you done? What are they key decisions that went into it?
   What do you think others did?
   Know about the CI/CD pipeline.
