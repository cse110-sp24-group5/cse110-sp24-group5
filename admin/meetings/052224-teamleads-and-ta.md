2. Calendar
    - Navigate through multiple months

    - You can add, edit, remove tasks for any given day
    - On clicking save, tasks should get saved to local storage
3. Dev Journal
    - Opens up on with the current date by default. Date picker can be used to switch dates
    - You can write in the markdown editor and preview, if you type too much you should be able to scroll in the preview and the editor. The buttons can be used to swap between editor and preview which overlay
    - For roles fulfilled - you can select whatever you worked on that day

### Feedback from TA

1. Releases on github. This is one one of the examples: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
2. Documentation
3. Use PWA - local first with data cached using ServiceWorkers
4. If the commits and branches are prefixed, change logs can be generated based on that
5. Focus on testing **unit, e2e, physical testing**. Can be nice to performing testing with actual users and get their feedback. What did we incorporate, what are yet to be done?
6. Analytics for the webstie (average user has notes this long, time spent) - may need a backend server for this
