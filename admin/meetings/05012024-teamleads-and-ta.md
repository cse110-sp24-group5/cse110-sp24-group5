### Updates
- Finished the warmup exercise for which we created the calendar widget
  - Set up github actions: `HTMLLint`, `Stylelint` and `ESLint`
  - Used `localStorage`
  - Users were able to select a date on the calendar, add or remove tasks specific to that date, and also check off tasks
  - We used github issues and separate branches throughout the process which were then merged in using PRs


- Reflection Journal Brainstorming
  - Pretty much entire team is meeting from 3pm-5pm on 1st May to work on the Miro board
  - We plan to look into the following:
      - potential features that may be useful to a user
      - user personas
      - journey maps
      - products in the same domain (and the design they follow for their applications and features they offer)
      - components we should have on the website
      - design basic workflows for the website
      - what do we want the end result to be - website, web app, something else?

### Feedback from TA

- Multiple sessions may be needed for brainstorming. Look at other journal apps.
- Go through the shapeup
- Developers are more keyboard-obsessed (focus on such minor details)
- CI/CD is important, assignment is released
  - Try experimenting with CI/CD stuff on the warmup exercise (try to asssign people to work on it)
- Design
  - Miro boards, figma (add links, screenshots in the repo)
- Process over design (for grading purposes)
- Coming up with ideas based on user research is important (focus on the developer journal idea). Eg `:wq` to quit
