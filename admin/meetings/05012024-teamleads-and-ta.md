### Updates
- Finished the warmup exercise for which we created the calendar widget
  - Set up github actions: `HTMLLint`, `Stylelint` and `ESLint`
  - Used `localStorage`
  - Users were able to select a date on the calendar, add or remove tasks specific to that date, and also check off tasks
  - We used github issues and separate branches throughout the process which were then merged in using PRs


- Reflection Journal Brainstorming
  - Pretty much entire team is meeting from 3pm-5pm on 1st May to work on the Miro board
  - We plan to look into the following:
      - potential features that may be useful to a user
      - user personas
      - journey maps
      - potential competitors (and the design they follow for their applications)
