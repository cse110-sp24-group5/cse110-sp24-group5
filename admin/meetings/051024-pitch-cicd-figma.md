## Decisions made and Reasoning

- Final decision was making a website and using an API (The Service Workers)

We are more familiar with making websites rather than apps and API to make it function as local first.

- Split into 2 teams to work on the pitch and the ci/cd assignment simultaneously

- Removed markdown feature

This was done in order to cutdown on a task which would be too complicated to execute in the alloted time.

- Added the template as a feature

This was done in order to give more structure to the journal, make it more customizable, and replace the markdown feature to be more dev focused.

- Updated the pitch and wireframe

This was done to reflect the changes above.
