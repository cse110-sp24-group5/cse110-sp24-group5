## Decisions made and Reasoning

- Split into 2 teams to work on the pitch and the ci/cd assignment

- Removed markdown feature

This was done in order to cutdown on a task which would turn out to be too complicated to execute in the alloted time.

- Added the template as a feature

This was done in order to give more structure to the journal and replace the markdown feature to be more dev focused.

- Updated the pitch and wireframe

This was done to reflect the updated changes
