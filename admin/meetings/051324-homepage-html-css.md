## Agenda Items

#### Unresolved from previous meeting

N/A

#### Things to be discussed

- How can we incorporate things from the figma into html and css?
- Different approaches we can take?
- How do we divy the work so no comflicts with merging?

#### Unresolved from this meeting

- Can't access the image files needed for the html implementation
- Implementing the slider and the images outside the first div may use javascript, so should we?

## Decisions made and Reasoning

- Each section/box of the main page will be a seperate div

By making each section a div, we can use the flexbox in order to get it to work easier for the conversion to website and mobile.

- Work on the website version first, then try and implement the phone version

Since the website version is simpler to implement, it makes sense to start with this first and then see how we can get the slider to work.
