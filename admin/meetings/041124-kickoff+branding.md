**Set up some rules of the development**

1. Complete all the tasks assigned on time and if unable to do so, inform other members of the team. 
2. Make sure you comment your code and add documentation so that others can understand the code and build on it!
3. Try to help each other with bugs! Maybe a slack channel for debugging related stuff?
4. Decisions to be made through consenseu, if conflict project leads would decide determine what to do
5. While making changes to the code someone else was assigned to work on, keep them in the loop.
6. Make changes to the code on a feature branch, test it extensively, then merge into main.
7. While pushing changes, have meaningful commit messages
8. If you manage to finish with your task early on, try to contribute to group efforts and help other members of the team with their tasks!
9. Short weekly meetings on Thu (4:40pm) to dicuss progress, updates, blockers, etc.

**Develop your team contract**

1. If someone makes an error, just try to resolve it by working together. Do not blame each other. Everyone is here to learn!

4. Don't be afraid to share your ideas and be open to opinions shared by others.
