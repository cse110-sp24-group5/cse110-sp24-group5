## Decisions made and Reasoning
- Miro board was created to Brainstorm
- Decided to limit to project to 6 features
    - Calendar: ability to add and remove events
    - Notes: with embedded markdown and the option to download as a PDF
    - Pomodoro timer: select work and rest - maybe the ability to analyze data over days
    - Habit tracking: positive and negative habits that would influence a score
    - Analytics page: tracks habits (give a score on a scale of 0-100), shows the change in habits over period of time
    - Dashboard: ties everything together
- Created User stories and looked at already existing journals for inspiration
- Divided into 3 teams for Workflows, CI/CD, and pitch
    - CI/CD: Mishka and Arnav (start considering potential ideas for github actions)
    - Workflows: Vishaal, Haley, Nicholas, Stephen, Hugo, Drishti, Maasilan, Angel, Xavier
    - Pitch: Everyone to contribute
- Members working on Workflows and Pitch are meeting on May 2nd from 3-5 pm to complete those assignments
