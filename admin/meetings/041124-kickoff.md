## Decisions made and Reasoning

**Team Branding -- Video + Team Page**
Decided color scheme (**Angel** is working on the logo) and mascot (panda) - blue and purple

**Drishti, Mishka, and Maasilan** - Editing the video

Video clips (10ish) seconds of **everyone**'s intro. What the group is about. Can we tie it to the mascot?

**Nicholas, Hugo, Haley, Stephen, and Xavier** will start working on the script and others will also contribute

Panda Coding Express
*Reasoning*? The theme animal is Panda and code is delivered in a quick and efficient manner.
