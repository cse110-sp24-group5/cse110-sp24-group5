## TEAM CONTRACT

### Expectations from team members:

#### General Principles
1. Complete all the tasks assigned on time and if unable to do so, inform other members of the team. 
2. If someone makes an error, just try to resolve it by working together. Do not blame each other. Everyone is here to learn!
3. If you manage to finish with your task early on, try to contribute to group efforts and help other members of the team with their tasks!
4. Don't be afraid to share your ideas and be open to opinions shared by others.

#### Development
1. Make sure you comment your code and add documentation so that others can understand the code and build on it!
2. While making changes to the code someone else was assigned to work on, keep them in the loop.
3. Make changes to the code on a feature branch, test it extensively, then merge into main.

### What to do if rules are not being followed:
As a team, we all believe in open communication. In case any member is observed to be not following the rules, this must be reported to the team leads. The team leads are then responsible for effectively and constructively communicating with that member to address the situation and come to a consesus.

Incase of inappropriate behaiviour is identified. the member will be given a warning the first time so that they can rectify their actions and realign them with the team again. Incase the member is found to not be contributing to the project, the team leads will try to work out potential solutions for them.

However, if the member repeatedly violates the rules and is harming the progress or cuture of the team this will be brought to the attention of the Teaching Assistant assigned, Akshay Prabhu for further intervention.
