## TEAM CONTRACT

### Expectations from team members:

#### General Principles
1.  Complete all the tasks assigned on time and if unable to do so, inform other members of the team. 
2. If someone makes an error, just try to resolve it by working together. Do not blame each other. Everyone is here to learn!
3. If you manage to finish with your task early on, try to contribute to group efforts and help other members of the team with their tasks!
4. Don't be afraid to share your ideas and be open to opinions shared by others.

#### Development
1. Make sure you comment your code and add documentation so that others can understand the code and build on it!
2. While making changes to the code someone else was assigned to work on, keep them in the loop.
3. Make changes to the code on a feature branch, test it extensively, then merge into main.
