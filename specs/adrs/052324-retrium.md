# Continued use of Retrium as a Retrospective Tool

## Context and Problem Statement

Should we swap to a different retrospective tool since one of our free trials is running out?

## Decision Drivers

* Clean UI
* Anonymous feedback
* Project deadline
* Payment Plans

## Considered Options

1. Retrium
2. Parabol
3. Miro

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "1. Retrium", because it is consistent with our previous retrospective iterations, has the most appealing UI and doesn't require any extra familiarization from the team considering that the project deadline is around the corner.

### Consequences

1. Good, because it has a nice UI.
2. Good, because it is what we've been using for retrospectives thus far.
3. Good, because members of the team will not need to get used to another retrospective tool.
4. Bad, because it will no longer be available once all team members run out of free trials.
5. Bad, because retrospective history will be fragmented across multiple user accounts.

### Confirmation

Discussed with the team during today's sprint review/retrospective meeting.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Parabol

1. Good, because it is open-source.
2. Good, because there is a free version that lasts forever.
3. Neutral, because it has a decent UI (not as nice as Retrium).
4. Bad, because it requires familiarization with the team.
5. Bad, because it isn't consistent with previous iterations.

### Miro

1. Good, because it offers a plethora of templates.
2. Good, because it keeps retrospective history close to our other Miro board (brainstorming).
3. Neutral, because its customizability comes with the cost of more legwork for members during retrospectives.
4. Bad, because it doesn't have anonymous feedback from team members.
5. Bad, because it isn't consistent with previous iterations.
