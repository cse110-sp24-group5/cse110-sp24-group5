# Dev Journal Changes (Sprint 2)

## Context and Problem Statement

How can we make the dev journal more dev specific? 

## Decision Drivers

* Dev focused UI and features

## Considered Options

1. Next steps for a project
2. Problems I encounter
3. What I think might be causing the problem
4. What fixed it
5. Things I could have done better
6. Ideas for improving workflows, processes, systems, etc.
7. Markdown note tracker
8. Role fulfilled
9. Bug Tracker
10. Summary

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "7-10. Markdown note tracker, Role fulfilled, Bug Tracker, Summary", because it is comprehensive and aligns closely with the needs of developers for tracking progress, responsibilities, issues, and overall project summaries effectively.

### Consequences

Good, because a Markdown note tracker allows developers to jot down quick notes, ideas, observations, or reminders in a familiar format, enabling efficient documentation and organization of thoughts.
Good, because tracking the fulfillment of roles within the team ensures accountability and transparency, leading to better collaboration and coordination among team members.
Good, because incorporating a bug tracker facilitates the systematic identification, prioritization, and resolution of software defects, promoting the overall quality and stability of the project.
Neutral, because it might not encompass everything a developer might take note of.
Bad, because it doesn't cover future goals and personal reflection of a developer.

### Confirmation

Approved in our general slack channel.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### 1-6.

1. Good, because it helps outline the next steps for a project, ensuring direction in development efforts.
2. Good, because it separates problems and solutions for bettery clarity.
3. Neutral, because specificity doesn't allow as much freedom for the developer.
4. Bad, because it isn't very concise.
5. Bad, because it doesn't consider certain file formats (.md) developers might want to use for notes.

## More Information
Removed navbar on all pages due to minimized features.
