# Service Worker API

## Context and Problem Statement

We aim to prioritize a "local-first" approach to enhance performance, reliability, and user experience. By leveraging the Service Workers API, we can achieve offline functionality, caching, and background synchronization, ensuring that users can access content even without a stable internet connection. However, we need to carefully consider the architectural decisions involved in implementing this approach to ensure it aligns with our goals and addresses potential challenges effectively.

## Decision Drivers

* Improved performance and responsiveness
* Enhanced reliability and robustness in low or intermittent connectivity scenarios
* Seamless user experience, allowing access to content regardless of network conditions
* Minimization of network dependency for critical functionalities

## Considered Options

Service Workers API with ElectronJS for desktop application development.

## Decision Outcome

We have decided to utilize the Service Workers API to enable offline functionality and improve the local-first experience for our website platform.

### Consequences

1. Good, because it enables offline access to cached content, improving user experience in low or no connectivity scenarios.
2. Good, because it reduces network dependency for critical functionalities, enhancing reliability and performance.
3. Bad, because it requires careful management of cache invalidation to ensure users receive up-to-date content.
4. Bad, because there is a potential increase in storage usage on client devices due to cached content.

### Confirmation

Discussed with the team on zoom during the 05/10/2024 meeting.
