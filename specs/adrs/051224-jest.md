# Jest as chosen testing framework

## Context and Problem Statement

What testing frameworks can we use that works well with other parts of the project?

## Decision Drivers

* Compatibility with local-first architecture
* Testing coverage for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
* Integration with existing tools or workflows
* Ease of setup and configuration
* Learning curve for the team
* Customization options for advanced testing scenarios

## Considered Options

1. Jest
2. Mocha + Chai
3. Cypress
4. Karma + Jasmine

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Jest", because our project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Jest is well-suited for testing JavaScript codebases. Its comprehensive testing capabilities, including unit testing, integration testing, and snapshot testing, ensure that we can thoroughly test our JavaScript code and catch any potential issues or regressions.
Secondly, we have implemented linting and code quality checks using CodeClimate, and Jest seamlessly integrates with such tools. This integration allows us to enforce code quality standards and catch potential issues or violations during the testing process, ensuring that our codebase adheres to best practices and maintains a high level of quality.
Another factor that influenced my decision was Jest's zero-configuration setup. Getting started with testing can be a daunting task, but Jest's zero-configuration approach made it easy for us to start writing tests right away without spending time on complex configurations. This was particularly beneficial for our team, as we had a tight timeline and limited experience with testing frameworks.

### Consequences

1. Good, because it is well-suited for testing JavaScript codebases, which is the primary technology stack of the project.
2. Good, because it integrates seamlessly with linting and code quality tools like CodeClimate, ensuring code quality standards are enforced during testing.
3. Good, because it zero-configuration setup reduces the initial setup overhead, enabling the team to start writing tests quickly.
4. Good, because it has less of a learning curve since we use it in our labs.
5. Bad, because it's zero-configuration approach may limit customization options for advanced testing scenarios.

### Confirmation

Discussed with the team during 05/10/24's zoom meeting.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Mocha + Chai

1. Good, because it is highly customizable for advanced testing scenarios.
2. Good, because it has various plugins and extensions.
3. Bad, because it requires more configuration compared to other options.
4. Bad, because it has a steeper learning curve for the team.

### Cypress

1. Good, because it provides excellent support for end-to-end testing.
2. Good, because it has an easy setup and intuitive API.
3. Good, because it has comprehensive documentation and community support.
4. Bad, because it is limited to mainly end-to-end testing, may not be as suitable for unit testing.
5. Bad, because it may require additional effort for integrating with certain CI/CD pipelines.

### Karma + Jasmine

1. Good, because it is well-suited for testing JavaScript applications.
2. Good because it can integrate with popular CI/CD services like Travis CI.
3. Bad, because the configuration can be complex, especially for beginners.
4. Bad, because Jasmine's assertion syntax may feel verbose compared to other frameworks like Jest.
