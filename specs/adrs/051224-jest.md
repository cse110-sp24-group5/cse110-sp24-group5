# Jest as chosen testing framework

## Context and Problem Statement

What testing frameworks can we use that works well with other parts of the project?

## Decision Drivers

* Testing framework compatibility
* 

## Considered Options

1. Jest
2. 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Jest", because our project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Jest is well-suited for testing JavaScript codebases. Its comprehensive testing capabilities, including unit testing, integration testing, and snapshot testing, ensure that we can thoroughly test our JavaScript code and catch any potential issues or regressions.
Secondly, we have implemented linting and code quality checks using CodeClimate, and Jest seamlessly integrates with such tools. This integration allows us to enforce code quality standards and catch potential issues or violations during the testing process, ensuring that our codebase adheres to best practices and maintains a high level of quality.
Another factor that influenced my decision was Jest's zero-configuration setup. Getting started with testing can be a daunting task, but Jest's zero-configuration approach made it easy for us to start writing tests right away without spending time on complex configurations. This was particularly beneficial for our team, as we had a tight timeline and limited experience with testing frameworks.

### Consequences

1. Good, because it is well-suited for testing JavaScript codebases, which is the primary technology stack of the project.
2. Good, because it integrates seamlessly with linting and code quality tools like CodeClimate, ensuring code quality standards are enforced during testing.
3. Good, because it zero-configuration setup reduces the initial setup overhead, enabling the team to start writing tests quickly.
4. Good, because it has less of a learning curve since we use it in our labs.
5. Bad, because it's zero-configuration approach may limit customization options for advanced testing scenarios.
